  <p>An algorithm M is described that solves any well-defined problem p as quickly as the fastest algorithm computing a solution to p, save for a factor of 5 and low-order additive terms. M optimally distributes resources between the execution of provably correct p-solving programs and an enumeration of all proofs, including relevant proofs of program correctness and of time bounds on program runtimes.</p>

  <p>Scientists at Rice University have developed a method of turning heat into light, which has the potential to greatly increase solar efficiency. Researchers at the university use carbon nanotubes to channel mid-infrared radiation (heat energy) into light energy using a film that absorbs thermal photons and emits light.</p>

The user-defined tree can be viewed as two different trees: intrinsic tree and instance tree. The intrinsic tree illuminates effective reconciliation strategies.
